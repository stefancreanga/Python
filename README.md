Small web application using Flask. It provides basic CRUD operations for managing user data (name and email). It uses Flask-SQLAlchemy for database management, Flask-Limiter to limit the number of requests (for security), and Flask-Marshmallow for validation of input.
In addition to that, it also provides another script to manage containers, namely creating, running, stopping, removing and listing containers.
